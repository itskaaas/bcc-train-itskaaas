# bcc-train-itskaaas

Iâ€™ve updated BCC-TRAIN so that each train now has its own inventory. Players without the conductor job can access it by using a lockpick to steal. When a lockpick is used on a train, it automatically triggers an officer alert through BCC-ALERT-JOBS.

- [bcc-train](https://github.com/BryceCanyonCounty/bcc-train) original version.
